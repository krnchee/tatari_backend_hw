# Tatari Backend Engineer Hiring Homework

This is a quick homework assignment that we give to our potential
hires.  It is intended to make sure people can write code and also
provides valuable insight into how they think about and solve problems.

## Timeboxing

We want to be respectful of your time, so any work on this should be
timeboxed to several hours, tops.

**Note: Please do _only_ the Backend Engineer homework assignment. :)**

## Description

Write a program in the language of your choosing that:

 * Consumes both `rotations.csv` and `spots.csv`
 * Generates output that shows cost per view by two dimensions:
   * CPV by creative
   * CPV by rotation by day

**No Jupyter notebooks or `pandas` or `numpy`, please!**

We love these tools here at Tatari but this assignment is about seeing how you solve problems with your code.
Show us your best software engineering skills, not how easy it is to do it with `df.groupby()`. :)

## Details

First, this is intentionally a little underspecified.  Feel free to
ask questions, or to just make assumptions.  If you *do* make any
assumptions for the sake of expediency, document 'em so we know you
considered them!

For the purpose of this exercise, here's some terminology:

 * "Creative" - Business lingo for a TV ad
 * "Rotation" - The timerange on a TV network that an ad airs in

## Submission

When finished, we prefer for you to send us a link to your code as a ZIP
file as our email will not handle archived files from candidates.  Also, we politely
ask that you do not post your solution in a public repository. Thanks!

## Questions?

If anything comes up, please don't hesitate to ask questions of your interviewer.
